Our app is a website designed to make cooking easier for younger people that may not necessarily have a wide variety
of ingredients or cooking experience. Users, once they are registered and their dietary preferences are set, 
can search for recipes via ingredients. They can select ingredients from a drop down menu, or type in manually ingredients
into a search bar. Provided the search made does not conflict with dietary restrictions, the user should see bootstrap cards
replace the search section, each with an image and title of a recipe that matches the search. The user can then click
on a card to see more information about the recipe, such as instructions, ingredients, cook time, and the dietary preferences
the recipe is compatible with. Users can change their preferences any time by clicking their user at the top and selecting the 
change preferences button. Users can also log out here. Searches are reset by a button at the bottom of the cards should the 
user want to make a new search. A link to our live site is provided below.
